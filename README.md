Story Time

Mrs. Melhase's father left the flughafen in Munich. 
The old man turned up the Musik in his Porshe as he headed towards Hauptstrasse.
After a long flight he was hungry and wanted to go by the Baeckerei.
He wanted to buy his favorite bratwurst and a loaf of brot.  
On his way, he drove next to a beat up ole Audi that spit and sputtered down Berlin street.
He was listening to his favorite band Rammstein as he passed his favorite Ratskeller.
As he drove past, he was distracted by a group of beautiful ladies wearing dirndls.
During this time, a poor "Hund" ran out in front of his car. 
He cranked his Rammstein music up so all the ladies would think he was pretty fly for a white guy.
