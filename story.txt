I sat in my Audi, turned up the Musik, turned on the Klimaanlage, and headed out to the Flughafen so I could fly to the Berlin. 
While heading there, I pulled up next to a BMW and began to get wettbewerbsfaehig to see who had the faster vehicle. 
He cranked his Rammstein music up so all the ladies would think he was pretty fly for a white guy.
I noticed a beautiful Frau wearing a short Dirndel and hit the breaks immediately. 
My tires made a loud screetch, as I had just missed a hund that ran across the street.
